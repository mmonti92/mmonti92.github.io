<p>
Finally some of Emmanuel's work work done in Aarhus is getting pushed out. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14834">Here</a> there's a preprint of our work titled 'Electron coherent phonon coupling in Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_{4}$ measured with ultrafast broadband spectroscopy', it presents some nice temperature-dependent time-resolved characterisation of this material. Good job Emmanuel!
