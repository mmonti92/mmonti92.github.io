<p>
Finally some of the work from Aarhus is getting pushed out: our work <a href="{{https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-3-3817&id=545722}}">{{ Determination and correction of spectral phase from principal component analysis of coherent phonons }}</a> was just online published on Optics Express.
This is a nice work where we used some nice computational techniques (principal ocmponent analysis) to exploit coherent phonon excitations in order to
measure the spectral phase of a chirped broadband pulse. Very useful as a simple method to measure precisly, and in situ, time zero in a pump-probe experiment.

Congratulations to the first author Emmanuel that gets the first paper of his PhD out.
