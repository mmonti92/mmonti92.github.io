<p>
It was a bit of a trip, but now I'm finally located in Le Mans. They managed to give my a card and some keys so I can enter the lab. This week everybody was in holiday so still waiting to get an assigned office, but they showed me the lab around and had a nice chat about science. Now lots of reading ahead!
