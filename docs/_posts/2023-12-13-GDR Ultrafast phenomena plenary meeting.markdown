<p>
Today the plenary meeting of the "groupe de recherce" dedicated to the ultrafast phenomena finished. It was a great conference and I assisted to numerous great talks. I also had the great opportunity to give a talk on some of my Aarhus work. I'll hope I will be able to attend the enxt one and finally presenting my work from Le Mans!
