<p>
Finally some of the work done in Aarhus is getting pushed out. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14853">Here</a> there's a preprint of our work titled 'Determination and correction of spectral phase from principal component analysis of coherent phonons', and presents a smart way to recover the time zero in a pump-probe experiment, very important with boradband pulses.
