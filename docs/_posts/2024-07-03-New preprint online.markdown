<p>
Finally our work from SwissFEL got uploaded to the ArXiv. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03013">Here</a>'s the preprint of our work titled 
'Disentangling heterogeneity and disorder during ultrafast surface melting of orbital order'. We measured the melting of orbital order in a manganite
using time-resolved x-ray diffraction both in the bulk and at the surface finding contraddictory observations in terms of the order dynamics.
We solved the puzzle by deducing that order is melted preferentially at the surface. We moreover measured a quickly generated population of localised,
disordered polarons by measuring the dynamics of diffuse scattering. From this we deduce that the melting of orbital order is polaronic in nature and
the restoration of the order is probably limited by the ability of polarons to reform an ordered state.
