<p>
I'm an experimental physicsist working on ultrafast spectroscopy of condensed matter. In my career I have used light pulses in a very broad range in the elctromagnetic sectrum, from THz to the visible to (recently) x-rays, to investigate the dynamics of complicated materials from <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07792">innovative emiconductors</a>, to <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.064409">quantum materials</a>. The wide range of energies and time scales used can be used to disentangle the different process happening in strongly correlated materials. <br/>

I completed my PhD at the University of Warwick, working on ultrafast spectroscopy of semiconductors, and afterwards I had a nice few years working at Aarhus university in Aarhus, Denmark.<br/>
Currently I'm working as a postdoc for CNRS. Based in Le Mans.<br/>

In my free time I enjoy listening to music from a wide range of genres and reading SFF books. Currently struggling to learn French.
